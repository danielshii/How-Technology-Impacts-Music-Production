    "Imagine shrinking a 7-ton pile of bricks into a single tile. Sounds impossible, right? Now instead of bricks, picture a 7-ton machine of wires and computer chips. Now, is it still impossible to shrink? It sounds far-fetched, but it actually is possible. As a matter of fact, machines that once took up entire rooms can now fit in the palm of our hand. This is all thanks to evolution, namely, the evolution of technology; as computing power increase, the machines that harness that power proportionally shrink in size. This phenomenon holds massive implications for many aspects of society that rely on technology. Music—specifically music production—is one of many cultural sectors that have reaped the benefits of modern technology. Every new-age hit that plays on your phone, radio, TV, etc. has its own production story; oftentimes, these stories consist of unique and advanced software/hardware responsible for powering the production process. These digital tools have drastically transformed the way music is made.",

    p1: "Within the last decade, music has been introduced to a plethora of advanced, powerful production tools, all of which have simplified and enhanced the production process in profound ways. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) Controllers are, without a doubt, the most revolutionizing pieces of modern music technology within the last decade. DAWs are simply software that producers use to create their music. DAWs possess a variety of power, including, but not limited to, sound banks, autotune, and synthesizers. There are many DAWs on the market, but the most popular one is FL Studio. Armed with a drag-and-drop grid, file explorer, and drum interface, FL Studio takes beginner-friendliness to a new level. Playing and generating melodies is as easy as clicking piano notes on grid. Similarly, selecting instruments and sounds that you want these notes to play can be done with just a quick drag and drop from the file explorer. Producers can even save these note arrangements as MIDI files that they can freely reuse with other sounds. For example, you can easily make your DAW perform Claire De Lune on a guitar as long as you possess the MIDI file, which can be obtained through a quick Google search. Clicking, dragging, and dropping are three processes that accurately oversimplify the essence of FL Studio. Such an oversimplification is a testament to the ease of use that FL Studio offers.",
    p2: "University of Liverpool’s School of Music lecturer Robert Strachan argues that a large portion of the creative process behind music production is determined by the “visual affordance” that modern DAWs provide. Namely, he states that “DAWs engage sight and touch in ways that have become increasingly enculturated into how we undertake a variety of computer-based tasks in everyday life.” (Strachan, 2017) Unlike production methods of the past, the GUIs that DAWs provide to a producer allows them to visualize the music instead of just hearing it. This phenomenon has made the production process drastically easier. For example, audio is comprised of a multitude of frequencies and balancing these frequencies is a crucial component of the production process; you want to ensure that a song takes up just enough sonic space in each pocket of frequency so that certain frequencies don’t overwhelm the listener’s ear. Since frequencies normally aren’t visible to the human eye, it can be hard to distinguish which frequencies of a song are unbalanced of one were to just listen to the song. However, DAWs have the power to take in a song or piece of audio and display the various frequencies that constitute it on a computer screen for the listener to see. For example, FL Studio has a built-in plugin called Parametric EQ which displays frequencies as bands of color. A band whose color is super saturated means more portions of the audio are gathered at that particular frequency. It provides a helpful visual signal to the producer that they need to tone down this frequency in order to make their production sonically balanced. Strachan, however, also offers a countering viewpoint to this phenomenon of audio visualization. He cites a study done by Gall and Breeze in schools where they found that students were “often guided by the visual, choosing [music] samples because they had interesting names and deciding where to place sounds within the composition according to the visual aspect of the screen without reviewing it aurally first.” (Strachan, 2017) Strachan argues that although being able to visualize audio as it’s being made can be helpful, some may have an overreliance on such a luxury and produce something that is visually appealing rather than sonically pleasing. However, he concludes his argument by stating that both “have become central to the working practices and hence creative processes of digital producers and musicians.” (Strachan, 2017) All arguments aside, there is no denying that the visual aspects of a DAW have played a huge role in simplifying the production process, and that can almost never be a bad thing.",

  midi: "Then, there’s the MIDI Controller, a DAW’s most trustworthy sidekick. MIDI technology has its roots dating back to the 80s and acted as the bridge between analog and digital hardware. A typical controller is characterized by its assortment of square buttons atop an electric piano. The beauty of MIDI Controllers is in the ability to map any sound to these buttons, allowing producers to play and record from their controller as if it were a real instrument. Mapping sounds is a simple process that can be accomplished by connecting a controller to a DAW, opening a MIDI interface within the DAW, then dragging and dropping sounds onto digital locations within the interface that correspond to buttons on its physical counterpart. Producers will typically map drum audio to these buttons and transform their controller to a full drum set. Digital instruments are usually reserved for the MIDI’s keyboard. Want to play a saxophone riff but don’t own a saxophone? Simply grab a saxophone from your DAW’s sound bank, map it to the keyboard, and play the notes the same way you would play them on a traditional piano. Now, you have yourself an endless bank of instruments in a piece of hardware small enough to store in your backpack.",

    "With the increasing accessibility and power of modern technology, the songwriting process has seen many changes as well; namely, we are seeing a shift from the studio to the bedroom. As Montclair State University Professor Adam Bell states, engineers and artists used to be seen mostly as separate roles, each managed by a different person—the engineer creates the music, the artist sings over it. “Put simply,” Bell articulates, “the musicians were responsible for performing the music, while the engineers confined to the control room were charged with the task of recording the performance.” (Bell, 2014) However, thanks to modern technology that makes music production far more accessible and simpler, we’re starting to see a shift towards what Bell likes to call the “Musician-Engineer”. One of the supplemental consequences of advanced technology is portability, with MIDI Controllers being the epitome of this phenomenon. Producers can have all the instruments and sounds in the world at their fingertips. With the amount of portability that comes with such technology, one can now turn their bedroom into a studio with almost no effort. Compare this to the 90s, where you needed real machines that had to be hooked up to each other in a particular arrangement. Now, 90% of these machines have been transformed into software, all of which can be stored in a single laptop. With how easy producing music has become with the help of technology, becoming a producer has never been easier. As Bell states, “A motivated individual with an interest in music recording, but no previous training or experience, could enter the ranks by sweeping floors and, in time, graduate to greater responsibilities...” (Bell, 2014) Affordability has also played a large role in inspiring this shift in occupation. As mentioned before, having a seemingly unlimited array of digital instruments and sounds on one machine drastically reduces the need to purchase actual instruments. After all, why invest in real instruments when you can recreate them digitally for less than half the price? “As digital music technologies emerged and evolved,” Bell cites, “the shift towards programming in place of recording live performances reduced recording costs, the need for studio musicians and the spaces for them to play in...” (Bell, 2014) Both portability and affordability have created a culture of accessibility in regard to production. It’s now easier than ever for someone to become a producer, thanks to the luxuries that newer technology has offered us.",
  edm: "Arguably one of the largest side effects of advanced musical technology is the rise of Electronic Dance Music, or EDM for short. Surprisingly, the technology that has inspired EDM’s popularity has its roots in analog culture, namely vinyl records. According to Mike D’Errico, Assistant Professor of Music and Computer Science at Albright College, there was just something beautiful when it came to manipulating music through vinyl. “In manipulating the deep wax grooves on the surface of a record, DJs sense they are “touching sound” and are allowed immediate access to the musical source and social context embedded within the object.” (D’Errico, 2022) However, as new technology came about, vinyl culture would start to lose its influence, exemplified by the discontinuation of the SL-1200 turntable, the once iconic vinyl turntable hailed for its simplicity and “minimalist interface.” (D’Errico, 2022) However, where one era ends, a new one begins. Rather than mourn the loss of vinyl culture, producers and DJs instead adapted to the digital age and applied their old tricks on new tools. With the help of MIDI Controllers, it wasn’t long before DJs found themselves reinventing their craft and performing like they never left. However, this reinvention didn’t come without backlash. For example, there was the famous “button pusher” debate where critics argued that EDM performances weren’t genuine since DJs could simply press play on their laptops instead of actually performing their songs. D’Errico provides an example of this argument by citing Peggy Phelan, who sees a performance as “’representation without reproduction’”, that a “’performance’s only life is in the present’ and that it cannot be ‘saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of representations of representations.’” (D’Errico, 2022) On the other hand, those in favor of EDM argue that it’s redefining what a performance should be and is giving society a fresh, new type of performance. Composer Simon Emmerson argues that software and human-computer interaction—where the human body interacts with a computer—has brought an aspect of “reanimation of technical objects previously thought to exist outside of what’s traditionally been considered musical performance.” (D’Errico, 2022) In other words, the performers are both the DJ and the technology they use at their shows; they work side-by-side to deliver live entertainment to their fans, and one cannot do it without the other. Furthermore, critics tend to downplay the work that goes into preparing for these performances. Many EDM artists will create VIP mixes, or variations of their songs that are exclusive to a singular performance. The goal is to give their audience a special version of their music that can only be accessed if they attend the performance. This not only incentivizes fans to witness their performances, but it also fights against the “button-pusher” stereotype that is pushed onto these artists. This process of creating a set list to perform is no easy task. Matthew Duignan states that certain artists that he interviewed often had to “painstakingly combine multiple pieces into a single project while being careful to merge their channel/track structure and audio effects-processing setup.” (Duignan) There’s a high level of detail and diligence that goes into producing a performance that both flows well and gives the audience a good time. All an EDM artist has to do when onstage is to press play, but the preparation that comes before their finger touches the play button is something that is overlooked and underappreciated. It’s ultimately up to you to decide whether or not EDM is “genuine” but one thing that cannot be argued against is the influence that technology has had on both the rise of EDM as a genre and its reinvention of what a performance looks like.",

    p1: "The most pivotal component of music production is the synthesizer, a musical tool that allows producers to create and manipulate a variety of different notes and sounds. The creation of the synthesizer dates back to the 19th Century. The idea came when Elisha Gray discovered that you could control sound using current vibrations from a circuit. The first synthesizer was developed by Thaddeus Cahill in 1901, dubbed the Teleharmonium. It was a bulky machine to say the least, clocking in at an alarming seven tons. It also didn’t last long, as it would often bleed into US Naval radio transmissions, resulting in its eventual shutdown. Fast forward to the 1950s, and the world would finally have its first functional synthesizer, the Mark II. Like the Teleharmonium, the Mark II was enormous in size, so much so that it took up an entire room at Columbia University. However, unlike its predecessor, the Mark II was competent, and worked with little to no faults. It wasn’t until the 60s where synthesizers would really start to make their mark on music, thanks to the Moog Modular Synthesizer, engineered by Robert Moog and Herbert Deutsch. The Moog’s architecture was characterized by the use of transistors, a new engineering concept that deviated from the traditional use of vacuum tubes. Although the Moog still took up quite a bit of desk space, it was far more portable than its predecessors, and it even came with piano keys. It was an instant success, used by the likes of The Beatles and The Stones. However, Robert Moog decided to take portability to another level with the release of the Mini Moog Model D, just seven years later. Now, musicians finally had a synthesizer that was truly compact; they could take it with them on tours and wherever else they so desired. Many new synthesizer models would roll out in the decades to follow, but the next true revolution arrived during the advent of computers. With the introduction of software, synthesizers, like many other machines, would begin their transition from the physical realm to the digital. Now, there’s almost no use for physical synthesizers. Apps such as Serum and Sylenth provide all the capabilities of primitive synthesizers, and more. The synthesizer is music’s greatest accomplishment, and its creation would not have been possible without the help of technology.",
    p2: "The heart of the synthesizer, as stated by EDM Producer Rick Snoman, is the oscillator, the source of the sound that comes from the synthesizer. Oscillators generate sound by converting “DC current from a power supply into an AC signal.” (Shelvock, 2020) The generated sound itself can be visually portrayed as waveforms, with the most common ones being the sine wave, square wave, and sawtooth wave, each having its own unique sound. As technology became more advanced, more styles of oscillators were introduced, allowing for more variety of sounds. “Many plug-in synthesizers now offer a variety of waveforms ranging from tri-saw, pulse, variable pulse, and tri-pulse to many differing wave shapes sampled from different sources.” (Snoman) Not only that, but every synthesizer has a variety of knobs and buttons that a producer can use to manipulate a waveform into a sound that’s unique to them. For example, you can adjust how long a sound fades in or out, how many voicings it has, its filters, etc. Advanced synthesizers even allow you to change the shape of the waveform as it’s being played. Combine the variety of preset waveforms with the modulating capabilities of modern-day synthesizers, and you get an infinite number of digital sounds that you can use in production.",

  conclusion:
    "As technology evolves, society is forced to adapt. Sometimes, this adaptation fails, resulting in jobs becoming obsolete and outdated. Music, however, has not only kept up with technology’s pace, it practically matches it. Developers and engineers have creatively designed tools that harness the power of modern technology to facilitate the production process. This has led to what some like to call a “golden age” of producers. Unlike other golden ages in history, however, a conclusion to this age is unlikely. It’s inevitable that technology will continue to evolve, and if music continues to keep the pace, then this is only the beginning.",
