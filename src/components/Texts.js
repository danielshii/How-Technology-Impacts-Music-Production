    "Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and MIDI Controllers are, without a doubt, the most revolutionizing pieces of modern music technology within the last decade. DAWs are simply software that producers use to create their music. DAWs possess a variety of power, including, but not limited to, sound banks, autotune, and synthesizers. There are many DAWs on the market, but the most popular one is FL Studio. Armed with a drag-and-drop grid, file explorer, and drum interface, FL Studio takes beginner-friendliness to a new level. Playing and generating melodies is as easy as clicking piano notes on grid. Similarly, selecting instruments and sounds that you want these notes to play can be done with just a quick drag and drop from the file explorer. Producers can even save these note arrangements as MIDI files that they can freely reuse with other sounds. For example, you can easily make your DAW perform Claire De Lune on a guitar as long as you possess the MIDI file, which can be obtained through a quick Google search. Clicking, dragging, and dropping are three processes that accurately oversimplify the essence of FL Studio. Such an oversimplification is a testament to the ease of use that FL Studio offers. Robert Strachan argues that a large portion of the creative process behind music production is determined by the “visual affordance” that modern DAWs provide. Namely, he states that there is\nThen, there’s the MIDI Controller, a DAW’s most trustworthy sidekick. MIDI technology has its roots dating back to the 80s and acted as the bridge between analog and digital hardware. A typical controller is characterized by its assortment of square buttons atop an electric piano. The beauty of MIDI Controllers is in the ability to map any sound to these buttons, allowing producers to play and record from their controller as if it were a real instrument. Mapping sounds is a simple process that can be accomplished by connecting a controller to a DAW, opening a MIDI interface within the DAW, then dragging and dropping sounds onto digital locations within the interface that correspond to buttons on its physical counterpart. Producers will typically map drum audio to these buttons and transform their controller to a full drum set. Digital instruments are usually reserved for the MIDI’s keyboard. Want to play a saxophone riff but don’t own a saxophone? Simply grab a saxophone from your DAW’s sound bank, map it to the keyboard, and play the notes the same way you would play them on a traditional piano. Now, you have yourself an endless bank of instruments in a piece of hardware small enough to store in your backpack.",

    "With the increasing accessibility and power of modern technology, the songwriting process has seen many changes as well. Before, engineers and artists were largely considered separate roles, each managed by a different person—the engineer creates the music, the artist sings over it. “Put simply,” Bell articulates, “the musicians were responsible for performing the music, while the engineers confined to the control room were charged with the task of recording the performance.” (Bell) However, thanks to modern technology that makes music production far more accessible and simpler, we’re starting to see a shift towards what Bell likes to call the “Musician-Engineer”. One of the supplemental consequences of advanced technology is portability, with MIDI Controllers being the epitome of this phenomenon. Producers can have all the instruments and sounds in the world at their fingertips. With the amount of portability that comes with such technology, one can now turn their bedroom into a studio with almost no effort. With how easy producing music has become with the help of technology, becoming a producer has never been easier. As Bell states, “A motivated individual with an interest in music recording, but no previous training or experience, could enter the ranks by sweeping floors and, in time, graduate to greater responsibilities...” (Bell) Affordability has also played a large role in inspiring this shift in occupation. As mentioned before, having a seemingly unlimited array of digital instruments and sounds on one machine drastically reduces the need to purchase actual instruments. After all, why invest in real instruments when you can recreate them digitally for less than half the price? “As digital music technologies emerged and evolved,” Bell cites, “the shift towards programming in place of recording live performances reduced recording costs, the need for studio musicians and the spaces for them to play in...” (Bell) Both portability and affordability have created a culture of accessibility in regard to production. It’s now easier than ever for someone to become a producer, thanks to the luxuries that newer technology has offered us.",
  edm: 'Arguably one of the largest side effects of advanced musical technology is the rise of Electronic Dance Music, or EDM for short. Surprisingly, the technology that has inspired EDM’s popularity has its roots in analog culture, namely vinyl records. With vinyl records, people could “manipulate” the music by manually "pushing the record underneath a turntable angle." (D’Errico) However, this primitive technology would lose its influence over time, exemplified by the discontinuation of the SL-1200 turntable, the once iconic vinyl turntable hailed for its simplicity and “minimalist interface.” (D’Errico) However, where one era ends, a new one begins. The most pivotal component of EDM production is the synthesizer, a musical tool that allows producers to create and manipulate a variety of different notes and sounds. In the past, synthesizers were once physical, bulky machines but like many technologies, synthesizers became digitized and are now available as portable software thanks to modern technology. The heart of the synthesizer, as Snoman states, is the oscillator, the source of the sound. Oscillators are portrayed as waveforms, with the most popular ones being the sine wave, square wave, and sawtooth wave, each having its own unique sound. As technology became more advanced, more styles of oscillators were introduced, allowing for more variety of sounds. “Many plug-in synthesizers now offer a variety of waveforms ranging from tri-¬ saw, pulse, variable pulse, and tri-¬ pulse to many differing wave shapes sampled from different sources.” (Snoman) Combine that with the increased capabilities of modern-day synthesizers, and you get an infinite number of digital sounds that you can use in production. It’s no wonder why EDM has become such a huge genre; you can create entire tracks and songs from just one synthesizer.',
